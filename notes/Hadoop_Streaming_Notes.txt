The HadoopStreaming jar in Hadoop 2.6.0 is located in the following directory:
$HADOOP_PREFIX/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.6.0.jar

To use Hadoop Streaming call the hadoop program as follows:

$HADOOP_PREFIX/bin/hadoop jar $HADOOP_PREFIX/share/hadoop/tools/lib/hadoop-streaming-2.6.0.jar -input <myHDFSInputDirectory> -output <myHDFSOutputDirectory> /
-mapper <pathToMyMapperProgram> -reducer <pathToMyReducerProgram>

As with other MapReduce executions, the HDFS output directory cannot already exist, it is created at runtime.
